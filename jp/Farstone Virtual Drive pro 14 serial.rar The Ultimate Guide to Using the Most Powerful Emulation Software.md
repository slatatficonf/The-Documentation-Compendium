With VirtualDrive, you can easily convert any CD/DVD disc into a virtual CD image file (VCD) by inserting it into your physical drive.

VirtualDrive offers many benefits over using physical discs, such as faster CD/DVD playback, no noise or wear and tear on your drive, and no need to swap discs.

You can create as many VCD files as you want and store them on your hard drive or cloud storage. You can also share them with your friends or colleagues via email or network.
